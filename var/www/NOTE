Homepage is basically ripped off from https://github.com/gokoururi/homepage but better integrated with my local archive of basically everything. This includes a couple of very experimental things I'm not ready to publish yet, like a danbooru clone written in C, archives of disappeared websites that even archive.org didn't save, local wiki clones, random shit, media streaming for my local network, etc.

data.html is essentially an injectable list. There should be one in every subdir.
