Conky configs are structured roughly like so:

section cfg {
	"#" ignore nextline ||
	"name" "opts" nextline
}+
TEXT
section text {
	text {
		"..." ||
		"$" cmd ||
		"${" cmd params "}"
	}
}+

The cfg section can simply be read and parsed very simply.
The text section should be treated as all plaintest with search-and-replaces.

It's probably simpler to convert configs to javascript, which can be eval'd.

Functions which technically have an equivalent already:

Conky:$hr				HTML:	<hr>
Conky:${color c}		HTML:	<font color="c">
Conky:$mem				Js:		memfree()
Conky:$memmax			Js:		os.totalmem()
Conky:$memperc			Js:		mem_free_perc()
Conky:$membar H,W		Js/Htm:	"<progress style='width:Wpx;height:Npx;' max='100' value='" + mem_used_perc() + "'></progress>"
