Atelier is a system monitoring tool, much like conky.

It's not conky, and contains no code from conky. It also functions nothing
like conky, nor is it configured like conky. That being the case, it CAN
do most things conky can do at this point - albeit with 1-2% higher CPU use
(which I'll see if that can be resolved.)

Atelier is based on the nw.js framework. Since this is web and javascript
code, it's pretty easy to figure out how you do things. Importantly, however,
is the fact that the web page is really just the template by which a
javascript event loop inserts the actual data. It also means MUCH more
simple styling than conky - no more asshole color commands strewn about.
CSS edits, and done.

More benefits - this also means the entirety of node.js,
npm modules and HTML rendering is available - some crazy formatting can
be done that couldn't with conky Like sideways monitors, my current
favorite impossibility without conky lua.

Since it's intended to be modified heavily, I can't use GPL in good faith.
I'm licensing this under the MIT for my sanity's sake. Nw.js uses the same.

Why Atelier as the name? I've been playing a game involving alchemy 
lately, and we all know by this point I like to name tools after things 
I like. Totori may have been a more appropriate name. ;P
