This is essentially a custom containering system. Jails, if you prefer. Do note that this uses chroots. What this means; use grsecurity or it isn't secure. It's not overly complex and stupid like Docker (why is that even a thing?) and it's also incredibly tailored for my use. I can't include some directories because -march=native...ugh.

base should be files shared between instances. This is binded RO.
data should be data for specific configs. This is binded RW.
mods should be chunks of code needed to operate, e.g. JVM. This is binded RO.
root should contain scripts to attach a system.
