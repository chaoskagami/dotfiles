This version has been patched to disable the BUY A VPN LOLOLOL notice. I use TorGuard, I2P, and sometimes Tor. I see no need to use their shit proxy, and having the notices all over the place makes me feel like I'm on windows. Their license is GPL, so they have zero right to complain about this. QED.
