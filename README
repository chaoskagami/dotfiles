This is a largely complete clone of what is in my configuration...which is to say, custom. You likely will find nothing truly of use here. Actually, maybe a few things.

Some notes on WHY in some of this; My LFS system doesn't have sudo, only su. Root is passworded. Why?
The OOB config for ubuntu is insecure. Giving the user the ability to run sudo using their own password,
and having no root password set IS THE SAME AS WINDOWS. My system is set up to require the root password always,
and my user password is completely different. Even when I did use sudo, it was set to require authentication as user, so it would ask root's password.
